## Backend (`api/`)

- This is the `api` folder (somewhat misleading name, I know, sorry)
- The live production version actually uses `www/api-cache` to leverage the CDN (BunnyCDN)

## Frontend (`www/`, `www-build/`)

- Written in relatively unpleasant vanilla JavaScript. My past self apologises ;_; ^Blair
    - TODO: Rewrite in TypeScript, much better.
    - New components are being rewritten in TypeScript! See `www-build/`.
